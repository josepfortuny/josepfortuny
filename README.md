# Hello, my name is Josep Fortuny ðŸ‘‹ 
### Telecommunication & Electronics Engineer 

Ihave recently completed a masterâ€™s degree in Telecommunication Engineering at La Salle University with almost two years of experience in SysAdmin & Cloud Consultant. I am a methodical engineer who thrives off continuous learning new skills and technics to improve as a professional and more importantly as a person.
I am able to work exceptionally well under pression as both an individual or as part of a team. I believe that the most ingenious results can be achieved by many people.
I am also capable of designing medium high electronic circuits and learning new programming languages in a short period of time.
